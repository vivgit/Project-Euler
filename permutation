abbc

rightmost which is smaller than next character- 'b' (first character)
the smallest to right of first character larger than itself- 'c' (ceiling)

swap ceiling and the first character

abcb

sort the substring in ascending order starting after original index of first character

abcb

Again, the first character=> 'b'
ceiling is 'c'
swapping
sort the substring after original index of first character
acbb

Again, the first character 'a'= 0
ceiling character 'b'= 3
swapping ceiling and first character =bcba
sort the substring after original index of first character
babc

Again, the first character 'b'= 2
ceiling character 'c'= 3
swapping ceiling and first character =bacb
sort the substring after original index of first character
bacb

Again, the first character 'a'= 1
ceiling character 'b'= 3
swapping ceiling and first character = bbca
sort the substring after original index of first character
bbac

Again, the first character is 'a'= 2
ceiling character is 'c'= 3
swapping ceiling and first character = bbca
sort the substring after original index of first character
